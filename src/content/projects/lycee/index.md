The project aims to make the gear shifting on a bike automatic, thereby enhancing performance and convenience for the cyclist.

The main objectives include using an Arduino-compatible weight sensor to measure the force applied to the pedals and a Bluetooth speed sensor to measure the bike's speed. The collected data is used to automatically control gear changes using an Arduino board.

Two operating modes are offered: an automatic mode, where gear changes occur without the cyclist's intervention, and a semi-automatic mode, where the cyclist must press a button to shift gears.

For the user interface, an LCD display provides information on the chain's position and the pressure exerted on the pedals, while a remote control allows the selection of the desired mode.

This project combines aspects of mechanics and electronics to provide an innovative solution that simplifies the bike riding experience.
