The EIP (Epitech Innovative Project) is a capstone project at Epitech, conducted during the final two years of the curriculum. This project encourages students to develop innovative and commercially viable solutions, working in teams of five to six people. Students gain skills in project management, communication, marketing, and negotiation.

The EIP culminates in presentations at events like the EIP Forum, where projects are evaluated by professionals and investors. Many EIPs turn into startups after graduation, offering students career and entrepreneurial opportunities. In summary, the EIP is a key milestone in the Epitech journey, integrating theory and practice with a strong entrepreneurial focus.

The project I've devoloped is Vakary. Vakary is a tourist application that lets you go on a trip without having to think about it. The application will create a personalized tour itinerary for you, which can extend over a geographical area according to your interests, the time you have available, your maximum budget and any other information you enter beforehand.
