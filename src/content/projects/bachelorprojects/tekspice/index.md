The Nanotekspice project aims to create a digital logic circuit simulator using object-oriented programming. Students must model various circuit components (logic gates, flip-flops, etc.) as classes, then simulate the circuit's behavior by propagating signals through these components. The project aims to teach principles of modularity, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism while developing skills in circuit design and simulation.
