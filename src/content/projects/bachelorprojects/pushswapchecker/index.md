The Pushswap-checker project aims to create a program that verifies the validity of a sequence of sorting operations on stacks of numbers. Using Haskell, the goal is to model the stacks, implement "push" and "swap" operations, and then validate whether a sequence of operations correctly sorts the numbers.
