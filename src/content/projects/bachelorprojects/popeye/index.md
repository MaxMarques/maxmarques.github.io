The Popeye project involves developing a Docker tool for analyzing and verifying container configurations. The goal is to create a program that checks the compliance of Docker configuration files (such as Dockerfiles and docker-compose files) with best practices and recommended security rules. The project aims to improve the quality and security of Docker deployments by automating analysis and providing recommendations to fix problematic configurations.
