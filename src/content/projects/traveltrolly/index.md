I noticed a lack of functional applications related to tourism and mobility in Miami Beach. Most of the existing ones were either insufficient or non-functional. To address this gap, I developed TravelTrolley, an app designed to assist tourists by providing real-time information about the free trolleys in Miami Beach, including their locations, routes, and stops.

Looking ahead, I plan to expand TravelTrolley's features to include recommendations for the best restaurants, information on local events, and important details such as beach flag colors and water temperature. This will enhance the overall tourist experience by offering comprehensive and up-to-date information in one convenient app.
