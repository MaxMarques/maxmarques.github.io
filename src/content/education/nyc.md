I had the opportunity to study abroad for one year at a partner school as part of my first year of master's studies. I chose to enroll in a Fin-tech program in New York City. During this year, I was able to improve my English, explore a new culture, study fundamentals of finance, learn to use the R language for data representation, and understand how to leverage vast amounts of real-time data for trading logic.
