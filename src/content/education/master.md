During my second year of the Master's program, I presented my project Vakary, which I developed over three years as part of the EIP (Epitech Innovative Project). This project allowed me to work in a start-up-like environment, aiming to create a functional beta version that addresses a specific need.

Through this project, I had the opportunity to lead a project from start to finish, pitch it to investors, and manage a team of ten people across different time zones, all while meeting deadlines. This experience helped me develop skills in project management, leadership, and communication.

Additionally, I completed two six-month internships, one of which was as a freelancer, allowing me to experience self-employment.
