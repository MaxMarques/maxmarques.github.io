PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) is a global professional services firm known for its expertise in audit, assurance, consulting, and taxation. During my first 6-month internship, I had the opportunity to work on these three subjects within the company:

- I developed an application in 'Alteryx' to merge multiple Excel files generated by users into a single CSV file, aiming to prevent human errors and overcome Excel's row limitations.

- I migrated 104 database models from Erwin to IBM InfoSphereÂ® Data Architect due to Erwin's obsolescence.

- I contributed to the enhancement of HEAT (PWC's Digital Service Desk) by improving the management of requests and incidents, without mentioning the integration with Microsoft TFS.
